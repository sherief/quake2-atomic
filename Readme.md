# Atomic Quake 2

Quake 2, runnable from a single exe file. 

You need to build the game data yourself to build this - from the demo or retail version of Quake 2 you need to extract all the pak files into the `baseq2` directory, then 7z the contents of the `baseq2` directory and put them in the source of this repo as `data.7z`. Works with the 3.14 demo version of Quake 2 which is easily obtainable.
